# kciredor's Neovim config.

Based on LazyVim.


The configuration loads several LazyVim Extra plugins by default, including support for different coding languages.

In addition you can toggle per device LazyVim Extra's, for example adding an AI assistant to a private device which is not allowed on a corp device.


TODO: Keep an eye on [CodeCompanion](https://github.com/LazyVim/LazyVim/pull/4268) using Gemini or a local model.
